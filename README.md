## Overview

This Tic Tac Toe game is implemented in Python and features an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Players can switch between player vs. player (P vs P) mode and player vs AI mode, with the AI offering different difficulty levels.

## Game Instructions

- **Press 'g'**: Change game mode (P vs P or P vs AI)
- **Press '0'**: Change AI level to 0 (random moves) Easy
- **Press '1'**: Change AI level to 1 (impossible to win by Minimax algorithm) Hard
- **Press 'r'**: Restart the game

## Features

- **PVP Mode**: Two players can play against each other.
- **AI Mode**: Play against an AI with adjustable difficulty levels.
- **AI Levels**:
  - **Level 0**: AI makes random moves.
  - **Level 1**: AI uses the Minimax algorithm for unbeatable gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the game.
- **Pygame**: Used for creating the game interface and handling user inputs.
- **Numpy**: Utilized for efficient array operations and game state management.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implemented for AI decision-making at the impossible level.
